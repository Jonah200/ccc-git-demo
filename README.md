# Collaborative Coding Club Sample Git Repository
This repository is for the purpose of demonstrating some of the core features of git for Collaborative Coding Club.

# Basic Git Commands
```sh
git init <dir> # Create a new local repository in the given directory (or the current working directory if not specified)
git clone <repo> # Clone an existing repository
git add <files> # Stage changes to given files. Use -A option to stage all changes
git commit # Create a new commit with the staged changes. Use -m <message> to specify commit message.
git pull # Get changes from remote repository and merge them into the local repository
git fetch # Update remote repository references (git pull is essentially a git fetch followed by a git merge)
git push # Push commit(s) from the local repository to the remote repository
git status # Get the status of the working tree
```
